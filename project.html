        BTS <b>(Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; or Bulletproof Boy Scouts)</b>, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean 
       boy band debuted in 2013. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write and co-produce the majority 
       of their material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their 
       lyricism has focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards
       self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced 
       literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</p>
